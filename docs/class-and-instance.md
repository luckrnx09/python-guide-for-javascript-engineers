Classes and objects are used to create and use reusable code. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is a specific instance of a class.

### Task

Create a class called `Circle` that can calculate the area and circumference of a circle.

#### JavaScript implementation
```typescript
class Circle {
  static pi = Math.PI
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  static createCircle(radius){
    return new Circle(radius)
  }

  getArea() {
    return Circle.pi * this.radius ** 2;
  }

  getCircumference() {
    return 2 * Circle.pi * this.radius;
  }

  toString() {
    return `[Circle]: radius:${this.radius}`
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(5); // or Circle.createCircle(5)
console.log(circle.toString()); // [Circle]: radius:5
console.log(circle.getArea()); // 78.53981633974483
console.log(circle.getCircumference()); // 31.41592653589793
```
:::tip
The `static` keyword in the class is not native to JavaScript, but a feature provided by TypeScript. In addition to `static`, TypeScript also provides access modifiers such as `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

#### Python implementation
```python
import math

class Circle:
  pi = math.pi
  def __init__(self, radius):
    self.radius = radius

  @classmethod
  def create_circle(cls,radius):
    return Circle(radius)
  
  def get_area(self):
    return Circle.pi * self.radius ** 2

  def get_circumference(self):
    return 2 * Circle.pi * self.radius

  def __str__(self):
    return f"[Circle] radius:{self.radius}"

circle = Circle(5) # or Circle.create_circle(5)
print(circle) # [Circle] radius:5
print(circle.get_area()) # 78.53981633974483
print(circle.get_circumference()) # 31.41592653589793
```

### Code Highlight

- In Python, classes are created by calling the class name like a function, while in JavaScript, the `new` keyword must be used.
- In Python, the `__init__` method is used as the constructor, while in JavaScript, the `constructor` method is used.
- In Python, the first parameter of instance methods must be `self`, which represents the instance of the class. Class methods need to be marked with the `classmethod` decorator, and the first parameter must be `cls`, which represents the current class. Alternatively, the `staticmethod` decorator can be used, which behaves like a regular function and does not require the first parameter to be `cls`.
- In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks within a class, while JavaScript uses curly braces `{}` to denote code blocks.
- In Python, members starting with `_` are conventionally considered private and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. In TypeScript, the accessibility can be restricted using access modifiers such as `private` and `protected`.
- In Python, members starting with `__` are generally system-level special members and are not accessible from outside.

:::tip Special Methods in Python Classes
Python has many commonly used special methods that can be overridden in a class.

Here are some of the commonly used special methods:
- `__init__`: The class constructor used for object initialization. This method is automatically called when creating an instance of the class.
- `__str__`: Returns a string representation of an object. This method is called when using the `print` function to print an object.
- `__repr__`: Returns a printable string representation of an object. This method is called when directly inputting the object name in an interactive environment.
- `__len__`: Returns the length of an object. This method is called when using the `len` function to get the length of an object.
- `__getitem__`: Allows accessing elements of an object using indexing. This method is called when using the indexing operator (`[]`) to access elements of an object.
- `__setitem__`: Allows setting elements of an object using indexing. This method is called when using the indexing operator (`[]`) to set elements of an object.
- `__delitem__`: Allows deleting elements of an object using indexing. This method is called when using the `del` keyword to delete elements of an object.
- `__getattr__`: Triggered when accessing a non-existent attribute. This method is called when accessing an attribute that does not exist in an object.
- `__setattr__`: Triggered when setting an attribute. This method is called when setting an attribute of an object.
- `__delattr__`: Triggered when deleting an attribute. This method is called when using the `del` keyword to delete an attribute of an object.
