Congratulations on mastering the basic Python development skills!

Before we move further, let's take a moment to test your learning achievements.

Here are some AI-related projects implemented using Python. I believe that after your study, you are now fully capable of handling them.

- OpenAI Python SDK - https://github.com/openai/openai-python
- Open Interpreter - https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter
- Langchain - https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain

Also, there is the AI book writing project that provided the manuscript for this book: abook - https://github.com/luckrnx09/abook
